# Code of Conduct

## Community Standards

Examples of expected behaviors that contribute to creation of a positive environment include:

  * Using welcoming and inclusive language.
  * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
  * Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
  * Focusing on what is best for the community.
  * Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members.
  * Encouraging and raising up your peers in the project so you can all bask in hacks and glory.

Examples of unacceptable behaviors that violate the CoC include:

  * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances, including when simulated online. The only exception to sexual topics is channels/spaces specifically for topics of sexual identity. Appropriate channels will clearly demarcate themselves as being such.
  * Personal or political attacks.
  * Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.
  * Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of “outing” of any aspect of someone’s identity without their consent.
  * Publishing private screenshots or quotes of interactions in the context of this project without all quoted users’ *explicit* consent.
  * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors to and admins of this project pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, technical preferences, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## When Something Happens

If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:

1. Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s) or commits.
2. That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue.
3. If this doesn’t happen, or if you're uncomfortable speaking up, message admins individually. Their names may be found by using the @admins command.
4. As soon as available, an admin will look into the issue, and take further action, starting with a warning, then temporary block, then long-term repo or organization ban.

When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.

**The admin team will prioritize the well-being and comfort of the recipients of the violation over the comfort of the violator.**


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within spaces involving this project and in other spaces involving community members.

Depending on the violation, the admins may decide that violations of this code of conduct that have happened outside of the scope of the community may deem an individual unwelcome, and take appropriate action to maintain the comfort and safety of its members.

### Other Community Standards

As a project on GitHub, this project is additionally covered by the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/).

Enforcement of those guidelines after violations overlapping with the above are the responsibility of the entities, and enforcement may happen in any or all of the services/communities.

## Admin Enforcement Process

Once the admins get involved, they will follow a documented series of steps and do their best to preserve the well-being of project members. This section covers actual concrete steps.

### Further Enforcement

These are the steps admins will take for further enforcement, as needed:

  1. Request the person to stop.
  2. If the person doubles down, they will have offending messages removed or edited by an admin given an official warning.
  3. If the behavior continues or is repeated later, the person will be blocked from participating for 24 hours.
  4. If the behavior continues or is repeated after the temporary block, the participant's account will be suspended.

On top of this, admins may remove any offending messages, images, contributions, etc, as they deem necessary.

Admins reserve full rights to skip any of these steps, at their discretion, if the violation is considered to be a serious and/or immediate threat to the health and well-being of members of the community. These include any threats, serious physical or verbal attacks, and other such behavior that would be completely unacceptable in any social setting that puts our members at risk.

### Who Watches the Watchers?

Admins and other leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the community’s leadership team. These may include anything from removal from the admin team to a permanent ban from the community.
